# RetailerReward

A retailer offers a rewards program to its customers, awarding points based on each recorded purchase.

A customer receives 2 points for every dollar spent over $100 in each transaction, plus 1 point for every dollar spent over $50 in each transaction

(e.g. a $120 purchase = 2x$20 + 1x$50 = 90 points).

Given a record of every transaction during a three month period, calculate the reward points earned for each customer per month and total.

Since we are using a SQL Express database it doesn't connect to when placed in APP_DATA folder when it comes to console application, for this reason we will have to copy the "RetailRewards.mdf and .ldf files to "C:\DataBase" directory for this solution to work as expected.

The DML and work out queries are placed in the "Database_Scripts" folder.  The "Insert Scripts for RetailRewards database.sql" was used to create the data for this solution.
